## Motivation

One of the things I fell in love with while studying computer engineering ( in a school I would not mention) was processors. I read on them, I studied their operation, I thought maybe someone should write an easier to use emulator that isn't over 600mb to download and doesn't make my laptop a hot plate capable of boiling a kettle of tea.
